## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
   +The Zone of Proximal Development was new to me! It's a good term to explain how getting pushed out of your comfort Zone
   can push you to learn.
   +The description of wanting to keep learning and improving programming skills resonated with me. There are so many
   programming languages and styles that you can learn about.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
   +Currently I demonstrate the growth mindset through my ability to make mistakes and learn
   from them.  I appreciate the process and problem solving nature of coding.
   +I struggle with using the S.M.A.R.T goals, often I will make the goals too large
   and unreasonable.  It is hard for me to guess the amount of time and work goes into
   a programming problem.


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning? I liked it because it had me practice recalling that information.  I got
to go back to my notes and make sure I had the correct syntax. It helped me see what syntax wouldn't work or what would still
work.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use. 

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
